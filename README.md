About Dash Proxy
================

Dash Proxy is a Mac OS X dashboard widget for quickly switching on or off different proxy settings.

In Mac OS X, if you want to change system proxy settings, you have to go to System Preferences, then open Network, then choose the network interface, then click on advanced, then click on proxies, and then enable or disable Auto, Web, Secure Web, FTP, Socks or other proxy settings. If you want to change proxy settings for your browser, you have to go thorough its preferences, then find the proxy settings, and then continue from there.

With this widget, you can choose a network interface (just once) and then quickly change proxy status by clicking on the appropriate button on your dashboard.
